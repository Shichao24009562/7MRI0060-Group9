# 7MRI0060-Group9
Contains cad design drawings, matlab code and arduino code The CAD design part includes all the part details of the first-generation robot arm, the second-generation robot arm and the third-generation robot arm.

The above CAD design is a joint design of the team, and I have included the rendering in the report.

In the Matlab codes, there are codes for displaying the workspace, codes for simulating a robotic arm to draw a heart shape, codes for GUI work, and three different codes for testing accuracy.

Most of the code content comes from the lecture content and has been appropriately modified. The specific parameters are adjusted to suit the general working conditions of the robotic arm.

The Arduino code contains the required PID settings and the necessary code.

The Arduino code only shows the setting of one PID. For detailed analysis, please refer to the PID control section of the report.
